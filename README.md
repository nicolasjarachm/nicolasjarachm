Industrial Civil Engineer specialized in Management Systems and holder of a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering Sciences.  
I am currently focusing on developing my programming skills, particularly in Python, with the goal of integrating technology, business understanding, and process optimization into practical software solutions.

My professional background includes experience in logistics, organizational development, and people management, which gives me a strong understanding of how businesses operate and make decisions.

I aim to combine this perspective with technical skills to contribute to innovative, data-driven, and scalable solutions — especially in dynamic startup environments.
